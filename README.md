## Ô∏è About

**WebLabeler** is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to create and manage custom labels for websites. It helps you easily distinguish between similar-looking pages by adding clear, customizable labels directly onto the web pages. This is particularly useful for differentiating between various environments of a single website, such as production, test, and development.

Perfect for staying organized and avoiding confusion when working with multiple versions of a site, WebLabeler ensures that you always know exactly which environment you're dealing with.
